# NMAP
Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free, open-source tool for vulnerability scanning and network discovery. Network administrators use Nmap to identify what devices are running on their systems, discovering hosts that are available and the services they offer, finding open ports and detecting security risks.

Nmap can be used to monitor single hosts as well as vast networks that encompass hundreds of thousands of devices and multitudes of subnets.

OPTIONS:

          -sS                    _scan all ports (never complete 3-way TCP handshake) - STILL SCAN    
          -sV                    _port and service versions on target

          -A                     _aggressive scan ( -O and -sV together)
          -sP                    _All Live hosts in the network                         ...Alternative - "netdiscover"

          -sU                    _access UDP port (expect to recieve reply back from system that port is open/closed)  -UDP SCAN
          -sA                    _determine if port is filtered / unfiltered (Check for firewall !) 
          -f                     _A typical nmap scan sends 24 bytes of TCP packet by DEFAULT (8 byte/fragment=3 fragments), 
                                  So each of this command adds 8 bytes=1 fragment to the Default sent packet.
          -iL <ip.txt>           _Scans a list of ip addressess from a file
          -sN                    _Ping scan, disable port scan
          
                       -T0          _Paranoid Scan [IDS Aversion]
                       -T1          _Sneaky Scan [IDS Aversion]
                       -T2          _Polite Scan [Uses quite less bandwidth]
                       -T3          _Normal Scan [DEFAULT]
                       -T4          _Agressive Scan [Speeds up scan, Take more bandwidth]
                       -T5          _Insane Scan [Assumes fast network, Takes most bandwidth and give up some accuracy for speed]
                             -oN        _Normal Output [Create text file that can be used for evaluation or into another command]
                             -oX        _XML Output [Input into different apps]
                             -oG        _Greppable Output 
                                        [Most used by Pen-testers to allow further investigation using grep or other tools like AWK, ACD, DIFF]
                             -oS        _Script Kiddies Output
                                                    
                                   --packet-trace     _you can see the exact packets being sent and received and learn how it really works.                             
```

### Agressive scan timings are faster, but could yeild inaccurate results!
T5 uses very aggressive scan timings and could lead to missed ports, T4 is a better compromise if you need fast results.



#### LOCATION _/usr/share/nmap/scripts_** -contains all default Nmap scripts


#### Nmap default script categories (Try yourself)
* auth
* broadcast
* brute
* default
* discovery
* dos
* exploit
* external
* fuzzer
* intrusive
* malware
* safe
* version
* vuln

#### Filter scripts by use-case
```sh
ls | grep ftp

    nmap -v --script=ftp-anon.nse <target_ip>
    nmap -v --script=ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.nse <target_ip>
```

#### NMAP Script in Python

Another script for Nmap using the above ip list we filtered. Such scripts are mostly used in Ethical Hacking for fast results:
*ONE-LINER Script*
```python
for ip in $(cat iplist.txt); 
do 
nmap -sS -p 80 -T4 $ip & 
done
```
(running all ip's through the loop ; Nmap stealth scan, port 80, speed check, and give out IP )


### MOST POPULAR SCANS

**_Network_ Scan**
```sh
nmap -T3 -sP <ip i.e. 192.168.0.0-255 (ip range) OR 192.168.0.0/24 (subent range)>       
```

**_Port_ Scan**   
```sh
nmap -T4 -p <port range i.e. 1-1000 OR single port> <ip address>     
                 (Range b/w  0-65535)
                 -p- (All ports)      
```

**Using _Output_ options**
```sh
nmap -sA -T4 -p 1-1000 <ip i.e. 192.168.0.106> -oN <output file w/ location i.e /root/myfile/scan.txt>
```

**No _Ping_ Scan** - Basically firewall blocks ping requests from nmap so it Bypasses that.
```sh
nmap -T4 <ip> -Pn
```

## Commonly Targeted PORTS

Port number | Service
------------ | -------------
7 | Ping
21 | FTP

110 | POP3 (Mail Access)
135 | Windows RPC
137-139 | Windows NetBIOS over TCP/IP
143 | Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
